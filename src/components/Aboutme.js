        <h4>Electrical and Information Engineering Undergraduate</h4>
        <p>
          I'm a 3rd year undergraduate of Electrical and Information Engineering
          at the University of Ruhuna. With a passion for software development,
          I already made a significant impact as a Front-end developer, having
          successfully contributed to a variety of projects. Skilled in HTML,
          CSS, JavaScript, DOM manipulation, and AJAX, I possesses a strong
          foundation in the technologies and techniques necessary to design and
          implement effective user interfaces. With a dedication to staying
          current with the latest industry trends and best practices, I'm an
          asset to any software development team looking to build innovative and
          engaging user experiences
